# Overview of the CBQN source

## clangd

Run `build/build clangd` to generate a `compile_commands.json` file which clangd will use to resolve the flags CBQN expects. Other `build/build` flags will also be respected, e.g. `build/build replxx singeli native clangd` will result in clangd assuming the `SINGELI` and `USE_REPLXX` macros are defined, and will resolve generated Singeli sources to ones `build/build replxx singeli native` generates (along with everything else the configurations change).  
(depending on the LSP in use, you may need to restart the LSP/clangd/editor after a modified `compile_commands.json`)

## Conventions

Functions starting with `m_` create a new object (some NaN-boxed, some heap-allocated).  
Functions starting with `q_` are queries/predicates, and return a boolean.  
Functions ending with `R` are either supposed to be called rarely, or the caller expects that a part of it happens rarely.  
Functions ending with `N` are non-inlined versions of another function.  
Functions ending with `F` are infrequently needed fallback parts of a function.  
Functions ending with `P` (or sometimes containing `p` or `P`) take a pointer argument (as opposed to a (NaN-boxed) `B`).  
Functions ending with `U` return (or take) a non-owned object (`U` = "unincremented").  
Functions ending with `_c1` are monadic implementations, `_c2` are dyadic (see [builtin implementations](#builtin-implementations))  
Functions ending with `G` can only be called with some guarantee (e.g. argument is heap-allocated, or fits in some type, etc).  
Variables starting with `bi_` are builtins (primitives or special values).  
Which arguments are consumed usually is described in a comment after the function or its prototype. Otherwise, check the source.

## Base

`B` represents any BQN object. It's a 64-bit NaN-boxed value; some of the NaN-boxed values, determined by the top 16 bits, are heap-allocated (i.e. low 48 bits are a `Value*`), some aren't:
```C
Type checks (all are safe to execute on any B object):
  test           tag    description     heap-allocated
  isF64(x)     F64_TAG  a number        no
  isC32(x)     C32_TAG  a character     no
  isAtm(x)      [many]  !isArr(x)       depends
  isVal(x)      [many]  heap-allocated  yes
  isFun(x)     FUN_TAG  a function      yes
  isMd1(x)     MD1_TAG  a 1-modifier    yes
  isMd2(x)     MD2_TAG  a 2-modifier    yes
  isMd (x)      [many]  any modifier    yes
  isCallable(x) [many]  isFun|isMd      yes
  isArr(x)     ARR_TAG  an array type   yes
  isNsp(x)     NSP_TAG  a namespace     yes
  isObj(x)     OBJ_TAG  internal        yes
  and then there are some extra types for variable slot references for the VM & whatever; see h.h *_TAG definitions

Functions for converting/using basic types:
  m_f64(x)  // f64 ‚Üí B
  m_c32(x)  // codepoint ‚Üí B
  m_i32(x)  // i32 ‚Üí B
  m_usz(x)  // usz ‚Üí B
  
  // convert B to a basic type (first one errors on invalid, second assumes the conversion is doable losslessly):
  o2b(x)   o2bG(x)   // bool
  o2i(x)   o2iG(x)   // i32
  o2c(x)   o2cG(x)   // c32
  o2s(x)   o2sG(x)   // usz
  o2f(x)   o2fG(x)   // f64
  o2i64(x) o2i64G(x) // i64
  o2u64(x) o2u64G(x) // u64
  
  // test if f64 or B fit in a specified type:
  q_fbit(x) q_bit(x)
  q_fi8(x)  q_i8(x)
  q_fi16(x) q_i16(x)
  q_fi32(x) q_i32(x)
  q_fi64(x) q_i64(x)
  q_fu64(x) q_u64(x)
  q_fusz(x) q_usz(x)
  
  q_N(x)    // query if x is ¬∑ (‚â° bi_N)
  noFill(x)    // query if x represents undefined fill (which returned by getFill*; aka test if equal to bi_noFill)
  tag(x,*_TAG) // pointer ‚Üí B

See src/h.h for more basics
```


All heap-allocated objects have a type - `t_i32arr`, `t_f64slice`, `t_funBl`, `t_temp`, etc. Full list is at `#define FOR_TYPE` in `src/h.h`.

An object can be allocated with `mm_alloc(sizeInBytes, t_something)`. The returned object starts with the structure of `Value`, so custom data must be after that. `mm_free` can be used to force-free an object regardless of its reference count.

A heap-allocated object from type `B` can be cast to a `Value*` with `v(x)`, to an `Arr*` with `a(x)`, or to a specific pointer type with `c(Type,x)`.

`TY(x)` / `PTY(x)` givs you the type of an object (one of `t_whatever`), which is used to dynamically determine how to interpret an object. Note that the type is separate from the tag used for NaN-boxing.

The reference count of any `B` object can be incremented/decremented with `inc(x)`/`dec(x)`, and any subtype of `Value*` can use `ptr_inc(x)`/`ptr_dec(x)`. `inc(x)` and `ptr_inc(x)` will return the argument, so you can use it inline. `dec(x)` and `ptr_dec(x)` will free the object if the refcount as a result goes to zero. `incBy` / `incByG` offset the reference count by the specified amount, but will not free the object if it results in a reference count of zero.

Since reference counting is hard, there's `make heapverify` that verifies that any code executed does it right (and screams unreadable messages when it doesn't). After any changes, I'd suggest running `test/mainCfgs.sh path/to/mlochbaum/BQN`, which'll run a couple primary configurations, including said `heapverify`.

Temporary allocations can be made with `utils/talloc.h`:
```C
#include "utils/talloc.h"
TALLOC(char, buf, 123); // allocate char* buf with 123 elements
char* buf = TALLOCP(char, 123); // alternative syntax, useful if buf is declared elsewhere
// buf is now a regular char* and can be stored/passed around as needed
buf = TREALLOC(buf, 456); // extend buf; may reuse, may allocate new space; won't ever truncate
TFREE(buf); // free buf
// if the size is guaranteed to be small enough, using VLAs is potentially fine
// but even a rank-sized buffer is probably better off in a TALLOC (if impossible to write directly in a shape ahead-of-time)

TSALLOC(i32, stack, 10); // allocate an i32 stack with initially reserved 10 items (initial reserve must be positive!)
TSADD(stack, 15); // add a single item
TSADD(stack, (i32*){1,2,3}, 3); // add many items
usz sz = TSSIZE(stack); // get the current height of the stack
i32 item = stack[1]; // get the 2nd item
TSFREE(stack); // free the stack
// note that TSALLOC creates multiple local variables, and as such cannot be passed around to other functions
```

## Virtual functions

All virtual method accesses require that the argument is heap-allocated.

You can get a virtual function of a `B` object with `TI(x, something)`. There's also `TIv(x, something)` for a pointer `x` instead. See `#define FOR_TI` in `src/h.h` for available functions.

Call a BQN function object with `c1(f, x)` or `c2(f, w, x)`. A specific builtin can be called by looking up the appropriate name in `src/builtins.h`, adding the `bi_` prefix, and invoking it with `c1`/`c2`. Note that these functions consume `w` and `x`, but leave the refcout of `f` untouched. (usually, which arguments are consumed is specified in a comment after either the function definition or prototype)

Calling a modifier involves deriving it with `m1_d`/`m2_d`, using a regular `c1`/`c2`, and managing the refcounts of everything while at that.

## Builtin implementations

The list of builtin functions is specified in the initial macros of `src/builtins.h`, where `A`/`M`/`D` are used for ambivalent/monadic/dyadic. Once added, `bi_yourName` will be available, and the required of the following functions must be defined somewhere in the source:

```C
// functions:
B yourName_c1(B t, B x);
B yourName_c2(B t, B w, B x);
// 1-modifiers:
B yourName_c1(Md1D* d, B x);
B yourName_c2(Md1D* d, B w, B x);
// 2-modifiers:
B yourName_c1(Md2D* d, B x);
B yourName_c2(Md2D* d, B w, B x);
```

For functions, in most cases, the `t` parameter (representing `ùïä`/"this") is unused (it _must_ be ignored for functions managed by `builtins.h`), but can be used for objects from `nfns.h` to store state with a function.

For modifiers, the `d` parameter stores the operands and the modifier itself. Use `d->f` for `ùîΩ`, `d->g` for `ùîæ`, `d->m1` for `_ùï£`, `d->m2` for `_ùï£_`, and `tag(d,FUN_TAG)` for `ùïä`.

The implementation should consume the `w`/`x` arguments, but not `t`/`d`.

## Inverses

```C
// im - monadic inverse
// ix - ùï©-inverse - w‚ä∏ùîΩ‚Åº ùï© aka ùï® F‚Åº ùï©
// iw - ùï®-inverse - ùîΩ‚üúx‚Åº w
// the calls for these must be in some `whatever_init()` function, and apply only to builtins specified in builtins.h
c(BFn,bi_someFunction)->im = someFunction_im; // set the monadic inverse; someFunction_im has the signature of a regular monadic call implementation
c(BFn,bi_someFunction)->ix = someFunction_ix; // etc
c(BFn,bi_someFunction)->iw = someFunction_iw;
c(BMd1,bi_some1mod)->ix = some1mod_ix;
c(BMd2,bi_some2mod)->im = some2mod_im; // you get the idea
// for new types, the appropriate virtual functions (fn_im/fn_is/fn_iw/fn_ix/m1_im/m1_iw/m1_ix/m2_im/m2_iw/m2_ix) can be set
```

## Arrays

There exist various macros to view the main metadata of an array:

| operation                          | `B x;`    | `Value* x` / `Arr* x` / etc   | result type   |
|------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------|---------------|
| get shape                          | `SH(x)`   | `PSH(x)`                      | `usz*`        |
| get item amount (product of shape) | `IA(x)`   | `PIA(x)`                      | `usz`         |
| get rank                           | `RNK(x)`  | `PRNK(x)`                     | `ur`          |
| set rank                           | `SRNK(x)` | `SPRNK(x)`                    | `N/A`         |


The shape pointer of a rank 0 or 1 array will point to the object's own `ia` field (the one read by `IA(x)`). Otherwise, it'll point inside a `t_shape` object (`ShArr*`'s `a` field).

Allocating an array:
```C
i32* rp; B r = m_i32arrv(&rp, 123); // allocate a 123-element i32 vector
i32* rp; B r = m_i32arrc(&rp, x); // allocate an array with the same shape as x (x must be an array; x isn't consumed)

i32* rp; Arr* r = m_i32arrp(&rp, 123); // allocate a 123-element i32-array without allocating shape
// then do one of these:
arr_shVec(r); // set shape of r to a vector
usz* sh = arr_shAlloc(r, 4); // allocate a rank 4 shape; write to sh the individual items; sh will be NULL for ranks 0 and 1
arr_shCopy(r, x); // copy the shape object of x (doesn't consume x)
B result = taga(r);
// see stuff.h for m_shArr/arr_shSetI/arr_shSetU for ways to batch-assign a single shape object to multiple objects

u32* rp; B r = m_c32arrv(%rp, 10); // 10-char string
// etc for m_(i8|i16|i32|c8|c16|c32|f64)arr[vcp]


// arbitrary object arrays:
// initialized with all elements being 0.0s, which you can replace with `r.a[i]=val`, and get the result with `r.b`; simple, but may not be optimal
HArr_p r = m_harr0v(10); // new 10-item vector
HArr_p r = m_harr0c(10, x); // new 10-item array with the same shape as x
HArr_p r = m_harr0p(10); // new 10-item array without any set shape. Use the arr_shWhatever(r.c, ‚Ä¶)

// safe known size array creation without preinitialization:
M_HARR(r, 123) // allocate a 123-item arbitrary object array
HARR_ADD(r, i, val); // write val to the next position in the array. The 'i' variable is just a hint, all calls must be consecutive either way
HARR_ADDA(r, val); // the above but without needing the useless 'i' parameter
// then do one of these to get the finished object:
B result = HARR_FV(r); // sets shape to a vector
B result = HARR_FC(r, x); // copies the shape of x, doesn't consume x
B result = HARR_FCD(r, x); // copies the shape of x and consumes it
usz* sh = HARR_FA(r, 4); // allocate shape for a rank 4 array. To get the result `B` object, do HARR_O(r).b later
// If at any point you want to free the object before finishing it, do HARR_ABANDON(r)

// If you're sure GC cannot happen (that includes no allocating) before all items in the array are set, you can use:
HArr_p r = m_harrUv(10); // 10-item vector
HArr_p r = m_harrUc(10, x); // 10-item array with the same shape as x
HArr_p r = m_harrUp(10); // 10-item array without any set shape. Use the arr_shWhatever(r.c, ‚Ä¶)
// run `NOGC_E;` after filling in the items to resume allowing allocations (not necessary if item count is 0)

// you can use withFill to add a fill element to a created array (or manually create a fillarr, see src/core/fillarr.h)

B r = m_c32vec(U"‚ü®1‚ãÑ2‚ãÑ3‚ü©", 7); // a constant string with unicode chars
B r = m_c32vec_0(U"‚ü®1‚ãÑ2‚ãÑ3‚ü©"); // ..or with implicit length
B r = m_c8vec("hello", 5); // a constant ASCII string
B r = m_c8vec_0("hello"); // ..or with implicit length
B r = utf8Decode("‚ü®1‚ãÑ2‚ãÑ3‚ü©", 17) // decode UTF-8 from a char*
B r = utf8Decode0("‚ü®1‚ãÑ2‚ãÑ3‚ü©") // ..or with implicit length
#include "utils/utf.h"
u64 sz = utf8lenB(x); TALLOC(char, buf, sz+1); toUTF8(x, buf); buf[sz]=0; /*use buf as a C-string*/ TFREE(buf);

// src/utils/mut.h provides a way to build an array by copying parts of other arrays

// some functions for making specific arrays:
B r = m_unit(x); // equivalent to <ùï©
B r = m_hunit(x); // like the above, except no fill is set
B r = m_atomUnit(x); // if x is likely to be an atom, this is a better alternative to m_unit
B r = m_hVec1(a); // ‚ü®a‚ü©
B r = m_hVec2(a,b); // ‚ü®a,b‚ü©
B r = m_hVec3(a,b,c); // ‚ü®a,b,c‚ü©
B r = m_hVec4(a,b,c,d); // ‚ü®a,b,c,d‚ü©
B r = emptyHVec(); // an empty vector with no fill
B r = emptyIVec(); // an empty integer vector
B r = emptyCVec(); // an empty character vector
B r = emptySVec(); // an empty string vector
```


Retrieving data from arrays:
```C
// generic methods:
SGet(x) // initializes the getter for fast reads; the argument must be a variable name
B c = Get(x,n); // in a loop, reating the n-th item

SGetU(x)
B c = GetU(x,n); // alternatively, GetU can be used to not increment the result. Useful for temporary usage of the item

B c = IGet(x,n); // skip the initialize/call separation; don't use in loops
B c = IGetU(x,n);

// for specific array types:
if (TI(x,elType)==el_i32) i32* xp = i32any_ptr(x); // for either t_i32arr or t_i32slice; for t_i32arr only, there's i32arr_ptr(x)
if (TI(x,elType)==el_c32) u32* xp = c32any_ptr(x); // ‚Üë
if (TI(x,elType)==el_f64) f64* xp = f64any_ptr(x); // ‚Üë
if (TY(x)==t_harr) B* xp = harr_ptr(x);
if (TY(x)==t_harr || TY(x)==t_hslice) B* xp = hany_ptr(x); // note that elType==el_B doesn't imply hany_ptr is safe!
if (TY(x)==t_fillarr) B* xp = fillarr_ptr(x);
B* xp = arr_bptr(x); // will return NULL if the array isn't backed by contiguous B*-s

// functions to convert arrays to a specific type array: (all consume their argument, and assume that the elements fit in the desired type)
I8Arr* a = toI8Arr(x); // convert x to an I8Arr instance (returns the argument if it already is)
I8Arr* a = (I8Arr*)cpyI8Arr(x); // get an I8Arr with reference count 1 with the same items & shape
B a = toI8Any(x); // get an object which be a valid argument to i8any_ptr
// same logic applies for:
// toBitArr/toI8Arr/toI16Arr/toI32Arr/toF64Arr/toC8Arr/toC16Arr/toC32Arr/toHArr
// cpyBitArr/cpyI8Arr/cpyI16Arr/cpyI32Arr/cpyF64Arr/cpyC8Arr/cpyC16Arr/cpyC32Arr/cpyHArr
// toI8Any/toI16Any/toI32Any/toF64Any/toC8Any/toC16Any/toC32Any
```

## Errors

Throw an error with `thrM("some message")` or `thr(some B object)` or `thrOOM()`. What to do with active references at the time of the error is TBD when GC is actually completed, but you can just not worry about that for now.

A fancier message can be created with `thrF(message, ‚Ä¶)` with printf-like (but different!!) varargs (source in `do_fmt`):
```
%i   decimal i32 (also for i8/i16/ur)
%l   decimal i64
%ui  decimal u32 (also for u8/u16)
%ul  decimal u64
%xi  hex u32
%xl  hex u64
%s   decimal usz
%f   f64
%p   pointer
%c   unicode character (u32)
%S   char* C-string consisting of ASCII
%U   char* of UTF-8 data
%R   a B object of a number or string (string is printed without quotes or escaping)
%H   the shape of a B object
%B   a B object, formatted by ‚Ä¢Repr (be very very careful to not give a potentially large object, which'd lead to unreadably long messages!)
%%   "%"
```
See `#define CATCH` in `src/h.h` for how to catch errors.

Use `assert(predicate)` for checks (for optimized builds they're replaced with `if (!predicate) invoke_undefined_behavior();` so it's still invoked!!). `UD;` can be used to explicitly invoke undefined behavior (equivalent in behavior to `assert(false);`), which is useful for things like untaken `default` branches in `switch` statements.

There's also `err("message")` that (at least currently) is kept in optimized builds as-is, and always kills the process on being called.

## Garbage collector

The garbage collector can run either at the top level (currently, between lines of REPL input) at full capability, where all unreferenced objects will be freed, or potentially during any allocation at restricted capability, where any object with a reference count not matching the expected value is assumed as a GC root (which usually means the object is referenced from the C stack, but could also be a leak if an error unwound the stack past where the object in question would be freed or properly stored).

Therefore, any code that may result in allocations must ensure that the heap is at a valid state (that is, most allocated objects need all their pointer/object fields initialized (more precisely, anything used by the object's `void [type]_visit()` function), including all elements of `HArr`/`FillArr` arrays). Manually `mm_alloc`ing an object will result in an invalid initial state for most types, but higher-level allocation function helpers usually initialize them to a valid state (e.g. `m_c8arrv`, `m_tyarrp`, `m_md2D`, `m_scope`, `m_harr0p`, `m_fillarr0p`, `m_fillarrpEmpty`), but some do not (e.g. `m_harrUv`, `m_fillarrp`); those will need a `NOGC_E;` statement to be added after you've initialized them (and be careful to do that only when actually done - the debugging options for a GC during an incompletely-initialized heap aren't nice!)

To add a permanent GC root, use `gc_add(B x)`. To add dynamic roots, the options are `gc_add_ref(B* x)`, which check & use `*x` as a GC root, or `gc_addFn(vfn f)`, where the given function should invoke `mm_visit` or `mm_visitP` on the objects it wants to assume as roots. `gc_add` and `gc_add_ref` and `mm_visit` accept non-heap-allocated values (i.e. numbers, characters, `bi_N`), but `mm_visitP` must not be passed the null pointer.

## GDB

A couple functions for simple actions within GDB/LLDB are defined:

```C
void g_pst()         // print a CBQN stacktrace; might not work if paused in the middle of stackframe manipulation, but it tries
void g_p(B x)        // print x
void g_i(B x)        // print ‚Ä¢internal.Info x
void g_pv(Value* x)  // g_p but for an untagged value
void g_iv(Value* x)  // g_i but for an untagged value
Value* g_v(B x)      // untag a value
Arr*   g_a(B x)      // untag a value to Arr*
B      g_t (void* x) // tag pointer with OBJ_TAG
B      g_ta(void* x) // tag pointer with ARR_TAG
B      g_tf(void* x) // tag pointer with FUN_TAG
// invoke with "p g_p(whatever)"; requires a build with debug symbols to be usable, but e.g. "p (void)g_pst()" can be used without one
```
